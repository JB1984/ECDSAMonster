# ECDSAMonster

Start of a basic program that allows you to create and trade cards with stats.

To use you simply use the issue function with the persons public key, and a path to the image you want to use for the card. It will then create a card with random stats and they will be the "owner"

Right now using simple Tkinter to display the card

append transfers as you would do with the ECDSA coin.
